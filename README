There are many color schemes for Vim that take their palette from the Tango Desktop Project.  What makes this one interesting is that it matches the colors to syntax in a way that mimics the torte theme that comes prepackaged with Vim.  If you've spent as much time staring at torte as I have you will welcome the familiarity of the colors coupled with the reduced eye strain of slightly lowered contrast.

It also adds a couple of definitions for console colors so if your terminal is using the Tango theme then you should hardly be able to tell gvim and vim apart...  Though I think this gvim cyan is better than the Tango theme that came packaged with my Terminal.  The Tango Desktop Project does not define a cyan so we have to improvise if we need one.

Not only did I do the tweaking for this but I spent the last week or so staring at code in it and I'm not sure I'll ever need another color scheme.
